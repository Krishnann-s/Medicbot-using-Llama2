# Medic-BOT using LLAMA2 
The **Medic Bot** is a repository for a medical chatbot that uses the Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML model and the pdf _The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine_. The chatbot has the potential to be a valuable tool for patients, healthcare professionals, and researchers. The chatbot can be used to answer questions about medical topics, provide summaries of medical articles, and generate medical text. However, it is important to note that the chatbot is not a substitute for medical advice from a qualified healthcare professional.
